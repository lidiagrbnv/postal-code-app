# Details

This project is built with React + TS + Vite boilerplate. For styling I've used Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI library.

Data-fetching and state management is carried out by react-query library.

API used for this app is https://api.zippopotam.us/. Additionally, I've used another [API](https://restcountries.com/) to display all EU countries in the country select field.

This project uses Google Maps. In order to see the map, generate your Google Maps key and add it to the `.env` file.
